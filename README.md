# Donut
Donut is a bot that was originally made in early 2020, and this is a remake, hopefully it will be better too.

# Requirements
This project was made and tested in Python 3.9 & 3.10, so I'd advicing using the same versions or something higher.
You can download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) at their website.

# Dependencies
**py-cord**: discord api library

**asyncpraw**: reddit post api
